			myMiniBlog is a blog application for different users to write their ideas into. The blog
			is equipped with a text editor interface so user does not have to bother with directly
			editting HTML elements into the blog post. User can also upload their choice of banner
			and thumbnail pictures to better represent their blog post. They can delete and edit the
			post after their initial posting. Currently, the site is yet to connect with database,
			so, the site is not at all functional. The backend side of the project will soon to be
